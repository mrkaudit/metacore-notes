# First observations

This note records initial practical observations from applying METACORE-based reasoning constraints to large textual corpora.

This document is exploratory and non-normative.
It does not extend or modify the METACORE standard.

Topics to be explored here may include:
- early signs of semantic saturation;
- failure modes at scale;
- tracing strategies that reduce entropy without over-constraining;
- boundary cases between adjacent domains.

Details will be added incrementally.
